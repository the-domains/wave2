# **The road to CCSP**

After spending a month reading both the [CCSP All-in-One Exam Guide][0] and [The Official (ISC)2 Guide to the CCSP CBK][1], watching 23 hours of video on [ITPRO.TV][2] and working through over 400+ practice questions, I finally arrived at the exam centre with a Red Bull and Cadbury Boost to keep me awake.

I felt confident that I had done everything I could to prepare for the exam, so I wasted no time and quickly packed my laptop into the locker before completing the customary security checks.

The first 10 questions totally knocked my confidence, and I was beginning to wonder if all my studying was going to pay off. I guess after working through over 400+ practice questions (and getting 90% right) I expected to see at least one similar question, I was wrong.

By question 60 I gave up any hope of seeing a familiar question and decided to simply answer the questions to the best of my ability. I started to forget about trying to associate the question with an expected answer, and instead focused on asking myself, what would I do?

As I answered the last question I was exhausted mentally and really had no idea how I had done. Clicking the end test button I cringed waiting for the result, only to find out that my result was at the reception.  Even the lady sat outside the exam room had no idea how I did.....yes, I asked!

After getting my stuff from the locker, I wandered over to the reception eyeing the printout that the receptionist was folding. Did I pass? I asked. She handed me the results saying she had not looked. I took the results and unfolded the paper as I walked out into the sun - Congratulations! it read.

So after 3 weeks of waiting for my endorsement to be processed (3 weeks of refreshing my inbox - a habit I now need to break), I finally received the e-mail I was waiting for.

I am now a [Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSPâ„ )][3]
