My [PM3][0] finally gave up the ghost the other day so I decided to take the plunge and shell out for a [PM5][1]. The Bluetooth link allows me to use the ErgData app to upload instantly to the logbook - plus I found a use for the old Nexus 4!

Now lets see if I can complete the Dog Days Challenge over the next few weeks...
